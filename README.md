# MES RAG System (Manufacturing Execution System - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for a **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** in the **chemical industry**. The system combines retrieval and generation to provide accurate and context-aware answers to domain-specific queries.

## **Installation & Setup**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mes-rag-system.git
cd mes-rag-system
2. Set Up the Environment

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preprocessing & Ingestion
1. Prepare the Data
This system handles data from multiple sources such as:

Text documents (.txt, .pdf)
Video Transcripts
Audio Transcripts
Structured Data
Place your data files (e.g., MES_text.txt, MES_gmpua.pdf, etc.) in the MES_Files/ folder.

2. Text Cleaning
The data is cleaned to remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stopwords. We also standardize the text to lowercase, tokenize it, and prepare it for embedding generation.

3. Media Processing (PDF, Audio, Video)
For non-text data:

Audio/Video: Use SpeechRecognition for transcribing speech.
PDF: Extract text using libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfplumber.
Embedding Generation
1. Generate Embeddings
To convert text into embeddings for retrieval, we use Sentence Transformers. The model used is:

sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
2. Embedding Process
The cleaned text from all sources (PDF, Text, Audio, Video) is converted into high-dimensional embeddings, which are stored in a FAISS vector database for fast retrieval during query processing.

python
Copy code
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize Sentence Transformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Example text data
text_data = ["MES system overview", "How does MES improve production?"]

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(text_data)
Vector Indexing
1. FAISS Vector Database
We use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to efficiently store and search the embeddings. FAISS enables fast similarity search for high-dimensional data.

python
Copy code
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize FAISS index
dimension = 768  # The embedding size
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Add embeddings to FAISS index
index.add(np.array(embeddings))
2. Flat Indexing
We use flat indexing for simplicity and ease of use, allowing fast and efficient retrieval without additional complexity. This is suitable for smaller datasets or when minimal tuning is required.

RAG Workflow
1. Input: Query from the User
When a user queries the system, their query is processed for retrieval.

2. Process: Retrieval of Relevant Documents
The userâ€™s query is encoded into embeddings, and a similarity search is performed on the FAISS database to retrieve the most relevant documents.

python
Copy code
query_embedding = model.encode(["What is MES?"])

# Retrieve top 3 most similar documents
distances, indices = index.search(np.array(query_embedding), k=3)
3. Output: Final User Response
The retrieved documents are then fed into a pre-trained T5 or BART model for context-aware response generation.

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize T5 model for text generation
generator = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-small")

# Generate response
response = generator(f"Answer: {retrieved_texts}")
Evaluation Metrics
1. Metrics for Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the RAG system, we use the following metrics:

Precision: Measures the relevance of the retrieved documents.
Recall: Measures how many relevant documents are retrieved.
F1 Score: A balanced measure of precision and recall.
Response Quality: Measured by human evaluation for coherence, fluency, and relevance.
Example Evaluation:
For a given query, evaluate if the returned answer matches the expected response both in relevance and correctness.

Scaling the System
1. Handling Large Datasets
Distributed FAISS: For larger datasets, FAISS can be distributed across multiple machines.
Sharding: Break the dataset into smaller chunks to speed up retrieval.
Caching: Cache frequently queried data to improve system efficiency.
2. Handling Multiple Simultaneous Queries
Asynchronous Processing: Use asynchronous APIs to handle multiple user queries concurrently.
Load Balancing: Distribute queries across multiple instances to improve system scalability.
Challenges Faced
1. Handling Multimedia Data
Integrating multimedia data, such as audio and video, required converting unstructured formats into text data using transcription techniques (e.g., using SpeechRecognition for audio and video transcripts).

2. Data Processing and Cleanliness
Cleaning diverse formats (text, PDF, audio, video) while retaining context-specific meaning was a challenge. Special attention was given to handling stopwords, punctuation, and tokenization across different file formats.

3. Model Complexity and Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning large transformer models for specific domain-specific queries (e.g., chemical manufacturing) required extensive experimentation and adjustments to achieve optimal results.

4. Scalability Issues
Scaling the system to handle large volumes of data and simultaneous queries was addressed by using distributed systems and optimizing the vector database for fast retrieval.
