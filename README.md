# MES RAG System (Manufacturing Execution System - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for a **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** in the **chemical industry**. The system combines retrieval and generation to provide accurate and context-aware answers to domain-specific queries.

## **Installation & Setup**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mes-rag-system.git
cd mes-rag-system



### Explanation:
- The section **"Set Up the Environment"** first creates a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`.
- Then, it shows how to activate the environment depending on your operating system (macOS/Linux or Windows).
- After setting up the virtual environment, the necessary dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  
Once this is added to your `README.md`, you can then push the file to your GitHub repository.
